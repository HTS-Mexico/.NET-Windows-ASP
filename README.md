## Hello #FutureShaper
I am glad that you passed the first stages of the interview process ðŸŽ‰ðŸ¥³. Now is the time to show us what you got! 

## The objective: 
Deploy an ASP.NET web application along with two Windows services.

# System requirements:

- Visual Studio 2019 Community Edition or above
- .NET Framework 4.7.2

# Problem description:
The **Delivering Orders with Great Efficiency** enterprise (D.O.G.E. for short) needs to deploy their new order management solution. Unfortunately, there is no active development team that can perform a Knowledge Transfer (KT) of this solution to you and all you have is the following information:
- The solution was developed in .NET Framework 4.7.2
- For now, it will consist of two main components:
    - **ASP.NET Web Application**: You are already provided with this code. You do not have to create it from scratch. This component retrieves the orders from the Windows Service.
    - **Windows Service**: It is thought to send the data to our ASP .NET Web Application.

# Instructions
## ASP.NET Web Application
- Try to run it locally, and then deploy a **production release** in your local IIS Server.
- The component will not connect to the Windows Service, so try to debug it.

## Windows Service
- This component is incomplete. All we have is the model of the order.
- Create the Windows Service from scratch.

# Submission
- You should submit your code in a GitHub fork repository
-	Commit as much as you want, remember to show good practices. 
- Try to code as clean as possible. Think of it as if you were tasked in real life.

Good Luck!
